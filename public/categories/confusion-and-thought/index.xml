&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is the time you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
—— By Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people have ever pondered over this question? And how many have given up thinking about it? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between those who can answer this question and those who can&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had exchanges with some friends on this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also observed the life choices and experiences of many people around me. Some of them are content with the daily meals in reality, smartly avoiding unnecessary troubles. Some are so absorbed in playing games at the moment that they aren&amp;rsquo;t attracted by this question. Some may have thought about it before, and their answer is that life is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a standard answer. But I suppose for some people who ask this question, they need an answer that can put their hearts at ease, because it will form the foundation of their lives and serve as the compass for their happiness in life. Fortunately, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found my own answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of life lies in building high-quality relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of this answer on me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I focused more on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;possessions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. These &amp;ldquo;possessions&amp;rdquo; defined me. For example, what kind of birth, educational background, skills, occupation, income, belongings, friends, personalities, achievements I had&amp;hellip; All in all, our life experiences are filled with evaluations and inventories of what we possess. People are also good at showing what they have to strive for conveniences and power in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is also the explicit rule of society, a rule that many people believe in. Therefore, people are always chasing one title after another, always longing to reach the shore (achieve a certain stable state). The reason why I say it&amp;rsquo;s an explicit rule is that I think we generally can only see the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; side of social rules and make attributions to it. However, I have a more positive expectation. The rule that actually plays a greater role is on the side of idealists. They don&amp;rsquo;t really need to be so pained about whether to conform to society or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized in my past thoughts and experiences that the life constructed following this logic is rather feeble. Even from a pragmatic perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s by no means the optimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, people pursue getting married but don&amp;rsquo;t care about building family relationships. People pursue building a career, constantly chasing quick-money projects and switching among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of the time, we only care about whether we possess something and what we possess, rather than caring about building relationships with them. When we bear the consequences of those relationships, we sigh, &amp;ldquo;Alas, life is just like this. Life is inherently bitter.&amp;rdquo; Or, &amp;ldquo;Alas, these are all illusory and unreliable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, having parents and children doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean having the joy of parent-child relationship. Having a wife or a husband doesn&amp;rsquo;t means having an intimate relationship. Having academic certificates doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean having independent thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me reexamine what is more real and what is more illusory in life, and what can bring people genuine satisfaction, tranquility, and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my view now, we can&amp;rsquo;t actually &amp;ldquo;possess&amp;rdquo; anything. We are connected with people, things, and events through &amp;ldquo;relationships&amp;rdquo;. All purchases, job entries, marriages, childbearings&amp;hellip; are the beginnings of creating a kind of predestined relationship, that is, I have a period of time to spend with &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo;. Starting this period of time doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee anything. What we can truly obtain is how we get along during this limited time, what memories we created, and what relationships we build.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our minds, we always want to possess. I think this is a lazy thought. It makes people think that once they possess something, they will obtain the fruits of the relationship. Besides, possession also brings a sense of not being in a hurry. Anyway, I already have it, and our attention quickly shifts from building relationships with the possessed things to possessing new desired things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Possession&amp;rdquo; seems real, but when we need to use it, we always find that it&amp;rsquo;s not that useful. &lt;strong&gt;Relationships are invisible and intangible, but in our difficult moments, it&amp;rsquo;s certain relationships that nourish us and make us rejuvenated. When we are in a downfall, it&amp;rsquo;s certain relationships that are like a net, catching us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our relationships with our parents and siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the year, my father was seriously ill and admitted to the ICU, with the risk of paralysis. Frankly speaking, instead of worrying about my father&amp;rsquo;s health at that time, I was more worried about the futures of my younger brother, my mother, and myself. During a private conversation with my mother, I said something rather unfilial to her: Even if he happens to be paralyzed and has no one to take care of him, I won&amp;rsquo;t allow you to go back to take care of 他 because of us or other reasons. You should live your current life well. So you see, although they are both parents, due to different relationships, the choices at critical moments and the emotions and support we can actually obtain are also completely different. My mother and I also formed some trust and established a friendship that goes beyond the mother-daughter relationship this year because of various tests. Such a friendship makes me feel more real than the identity of mother and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our relationship with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we take our bodies seriously and make ourselves have a strong physique? Do we take our souls seriously, patiently and meticulously care about them, and create a fertile land for them? How many times do we put them at the end, abuse them, overdraw them, enslave them, or give them empty promises? We let ourselves suffer unbearably and even PUA ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our relationship with our careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people say that work is meaningless and the meaning of work lies in earning money to live. Is that really the case? There was also a very popular book in the past two years called &amp;ldquo;Bullshit Jobs&amp;rdquo;, and I have a copy too. It means that in modern division of labor, there are many jobs that are meaningless for personal growth and development, and their existence is just for the needs of maintaining rule and stability and for the needs of a small number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the current workplace jobs, it&amp;rsquo;s indeed the case. It can&amp;rsquo;t provide meaning, and it can&amp;rsquo;t even keep things peaceful. On the contrary, it&amp;rsquo;s quite harmful to people&amp;rsquo;s psychology. And in the short term, this situation is hard to change. For the sake of survival, people have to endure it. If they really can&amp;rsquo;t bear it, they just change to another job. Therefore, it not only fails to provide meaning in work but also destroys people&amp;rsquo;s efforts to build stable social and interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Principles&amp;rdquo;, Ray Dalio mentioned that he thought what brings people happiness is not money at all, but doing a meaningful thing with a group of like-minded partners. I deeply agree with this. Calculated carefully, work occupies the vast majority of our time and defines our positions in the social network. It&amp;rsquo;s of great significance for the overall happiness of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to sacrifice the overall happiness of life, I can&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice the happiness of work. Or to be more accurate, replacing &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;career&amp;rdquo; is better. Work is the daily part after the career is broken down, and it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable to have trivial and boring components. While career, from a more macroscopic level, brings meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we truly start to care about the &amp;ldquo;relationship&amp;rdquo; itself, our daily mindsets and behaviors will also change accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I no longer take the love from relatives and friends for granted and just immerse myself in those endless affairs. Instead, I care more about conveying to them that I care about them and cherish them in both daily life and at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer think that I should exercise because I want to lose weight, because I want to be beautiful, or because exercise is a good habit, but always start and stop inconsistently. Instead, I want to live a high-quality life for a longer time, expecting to have a more energetic body and mind. With such recognition, it no longer becomes something difficult to persist in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer think that according to my personality, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this or I&amp;rsquo;m not good at that. Instead, under the bigger goal of &amp;ldquo;I need a career with good relationships&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to make more attempts and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer think that continuous learning is a hard thing. For example, in German learning, there is a large amount of memory and recitation work, but since it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary tool for me to achieve my goals, I&amp;rsquo;m determined to get along well with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer stare at what others possess, nor do I focus on what goals I need to complete, what tasks I need to finish, or how much money I need to save. Instead, I pay more attention to which people, things, and events I should choose to build my life and establish robust relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly defines our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do some people feel that after years of busyness, it&amp;rsquo;s all in vain? There is also a popular saying online that &amp;ldquo;People live for a moment&amp;rdquo;. Such a saying regards daily life as mediocre and seems to encourage us to create a highlight moment, which is enough to resist the boredom and vulgarity of daily life, just like drawing a gecko and then adding the finishing touch to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What defines our lives is the things we choose to build relationships with and what kind of relationships we build. You build relationships truthfully without any deception. Because of the commitment, you don&amp;rsquo;t easily do things that damage these relationships, and in daily life, you continuously use &amp;ldquo;LOVE&amp;rdquo; to nourish their growth. You enjoy the process of building relationships and are full of patience. And when the time comes, you taste the fruits of these relationships, which is a natural highlight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my answer about the meaning of life, and I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Gravity and Gravitational Pull of Life</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/the-gravitational-force-of-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/the-gravitational-force-of-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/the-gravitational-force-of-life/img.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Gravity and Gravitational Pull of Life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering what kind of person I hope to become and what kind of life I expect to have. Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been observing and taking stock of what things will promote my growth and what will hold me back.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually summed up some key points. Some of them are my habitual reactions, which, like gravity, make me sink in life and require me to consciously recognize and overcome them. While others are aspects that I remind myself to cultivate and strengthen, so as to put myself in a better state and attract dreams and good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;01-the-gravity-of-life&#34;&gt;01. The Gravity of Life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the two most crucial aspects are greed and laziness.
For others, the answers might be different. For example, for some people, it might be arrogance; for others, it could be a sense of superiority; some might struggle with inferiority, and still others might have a problem with not being able to tell what&amp;rsquo;s important and what&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip;
All in all, the first step is to identify these issues, and the second step is to make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;greed&#34;&gt;Greed
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first drawback of greed is shallowness.
To put it simply, greed means wanting everything. However, people&amp;rsquo;s time and attention are limited. The consequence of wanting everything is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for us to allocate sufficient resources to certain things and build strong relationships with them. We always just touch the surface, linger everywhere, and build a very broad network, yet it&amp;rsquo;s rather weak and can be easily broken. Over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reorganizing my desires, choosing those that I&amp;rsquo;m willing to invest in for the long term and suppressing those that are just on a whim. I think there are some higher-level and more delightful joys that come from persistent efforts in one thing. Then, at a certain moment, it can bring about the understanding of related things and epiphanies. It&amp;rsquo;s like getting along with some things as if they were old friends, and then discovering something new in these old friends, savoring new flavors from the familiar.
The second drawback of greed is getting sidetracked.
For instance, when I&amp;rsquo;m confused and get a flash of inspiration from a certain type of book, I&amp;rsquo;m almost tempted to shut myself up and read all the related books until I can build a framework and no longer be troubled by such problems. Then I start collecting reading lists. My focus shifts from this specific small problem at hand to a larger problem that&amp;rsquo;s not so urgent in the short term. My energy is diverted from solving this small problem to collecting reading lists, which is an indirect and problem-solving-ineffective thing. My attention shifts from focusing on this small problem to the anxiety that there&amp;rsquo;s never enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;laziness&#34;&gt;Laziness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an extremely lazy person. On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s because I have very low energy levels. I can&amp;rsquo;t stay up late at all. My mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very fast either. Group activities are like recharging for others, but for me, they&amp;rsquo;re draining my energy. I have little energy to start with, my mind operates slowly, and I consume energy quickly in daily life, so I&amp;rsquo;m often in a low-energy-consuming mode, daydreaming. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to change this now. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to boost my mental speed. Instead of forcing myself to work harder, I can only figure out a battlefield that suits me better. For example, studying some classics is more suitable for me than researching hot topics.
On the other hand, I have very low initiative. I think a lot but do little. This is probably a common problem and doesn&amp;rsquo;t need much explanation. Not only is my initiative low, but I also have high aspirations but low abilities. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this or that. This is really not good, and I need to find some strategies to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;02-the-gravitational-pull-of-life&#34;&gt;02. The Gravitational Pull of Life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve selected these aspects one by one as the gravitational pull for myself: curiosity, courage, honesty, and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;curiosity&#34;&gt;Curiosity
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the essential quality for a good life needs to include curiosity.
We need to have curiosity when we look forward to a better self and a better life. We need curiosity when we design a better life. When building a career, we also need very high-quality and focused curiosity.
Without curiosity, everything is just: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it.&amp;rdquo;
With curiosity, everything can be: &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s more to it than that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;courage&#34;&gt;Courage
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying on the Internet goes: &amp;ldquo;The brave ones get to enjoy the world first.&amp;rdquo;
Regardless of whether this slogan-like declaration is correct or not, on the path of satisfying curiosity and moving forward on our own, courage is essential. People without courage can&amp;rsquo;t move forward independently and gain freedom. At some necessary moments, after assessing our own strength, we need to have the courage to take a leap.
Moreover, it takes enough courage to stay honest. We need to face difficulties, face reality squarely, and make detours when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;honesty&#34;&gt;Honesty
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honesty is also something that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to value more and more. Be honest with myself and be honest with the world.
When I realize my desires, my sadness, my anxiety, my weakness&amp;hellip; I admit them for what they are, analyze them, and soothe them instead of disguising them.
Another thing that struck me this year is that recognition is a kind of power.
During my conversations with my mother, I&amp;rsquo;ve been more open and unrestrained in chatting with her about many things, like her new relationship, her sexual experiences, and so on.
When we try to hide certain things, this attitude of hiding and not recognizing them brings a psychological burden. But when we communicate normally, the sense of uneasiness and insecurity in the other person&amp;rsquo;s heart disappears. She gains a more aboveboard confidence, and I can also feel her relaxation and trust in me.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be more honest in facing myself and communicating with others. Actually, I think different groups of people have different local rules. I choose the rules that make me feel more relaxed and empowered, as well as the people and situations where these rules can bring me positive feedback.
Be honest with the world, be honest with reality, and be honest with the rules.
When we encounter setbacks, we often spend a lot of time taking care of our self-esteem. But what hurts us is our own inferiority and self-pity.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to accept reality and the rules of reality more. Reality is indifferent, treating all things as straw dogs. People only care about those things and people that are related to them and helpful to them. So you don&amp;rsquo;t have to feel sad just because you seem insignificant and unnoticed. Rules are those that govern interpersonal interactions. They are a reality and an objective existence that apply to everyone. Instead of always being accidentally hurt by them, feeling sad and discouraged, and then making wrong attributions to comfort our self-esteem, it&amp;rsquo;s better to face them honestly in a neutral way, recognize them, adapt to them, and practice using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;happiness&#34;&gt;Happiness
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met a girl in Chiang Mai. She said that when you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to choose, just choose happiness. At that time, I refuted her, thinking that happiness was a short-sighted choice and that it might not necessarily bring us what we really want. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind.
I dislike being overly serious and pretentious. Although what I&amp;rsquo;m writing here might seem rather serious and pretentious too. We naturally love stories, games, and happiness. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but always look for meaning and value in everything. However, being too serious and solemn leaves no room for discovering fun and absurdity. What I want to remind myself is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be so solemn. We can be more relaxed and cheerful&amp;hellip; In a world that&amp;rsquo;s only about meaning, we can&amp;rsquo;t recognize meaning. We recognize meaning because we first recognize meaninglessness.
After Fu Hang became famous overnight, he said in an interview: &amp;ldquo;In this world, both you and I are too involved in our roles, and that will bring pain. People are inexplicably pushed forward by fate. Suddenly, you become a mother, a child, or an employee, but we all take these roles too seriously.&amp;rdquo;
Yes, I also think that sometimes we take our roles too seriously.
I also saw an interesting post. An overseas student put a sofa in different street scenes and took many photos with it. I thought he was doing some artistic creation. In fact, he was just a German student studying abroad. He bought a second-hand sofa and wanted to move it home with his friends. The sofa was so heavy that they had to take a break after moving it a short distance. So he simply turned it into a fun thing and took many &amp;ldquo;blockbuster&amp;rdquo; photos. Turning a tiring task into an interesting memory is the magic of finding happiness.
Having a cheerful mood is very important, so don&amp;rsquo;t be so serious and gloomy.

        <title>Three mmmost important things</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/post/the-three-most-important-things/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/the-three-most-important-things/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/the-three-most-important-things/img.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Three mmmost important things" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, we talked about how the meaning of life lies in building some strong relationships. Such relationships can make us truly feel happy and help us overcome challenges when faced with trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what kinds of relationships do we need to build?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, I was traveling in Paris with Ko. One night, we were sitting outside a bistro in Paris, and she asked me what the three most important things in my life would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a clear and definite answer for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, maybe there has been a slight change, and here are my current choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong and agile body and mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A career that inspires passion and a skill for making money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intimate and supportive interpersonal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite similar to Naval&amp;rsquo;s formula for happiness. Naval once gave a life formula: Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Interpersonal Relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book &amp;ldquo;Principles&amp;rdquo;, Ray Dalio also put forward that for him, a successful life means having meaningful work and meaningful interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that for most people, if they want a balanced and sustainable sense of happiness, their final answers will probably be more or less the same, regarding health, love, and work. However, the important thing is not that we know a &amp;ldquo;standard answer&amp;rdquo;. The crucial point is that we need to rule out options one by one, carefully analyze and distinguish, and then derive our own clear and definite answers. It&amp;rsquo;s like drawing up a personal charter. This process implies genuine recognition and commitment. &lt;strong&gt;It means that we will do our best to build relationships with them in a creative and responsible way. We won&amp;rsquo;t always be led by the nose by urgent tasks, nor will we damage these relationships because of trifles in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;01-a-strong-body-and-a-sensitive-mind&#34;&gt;01 A Strong Body and a Sensitive Mind
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that health is important and exercise is important. However, the reality is that people often say one thing and do another. &lt;strong&gt;The reason, I think, is that people just repeat some ideas that have been instilled into them without truly identifying with those values at a fundamental level, so naturally those ideas can&amp;rsquo;t guide their behaviors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the widely circulated saying on the Internet goes, human beings are like parrots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also explains why I always wanted to develop an exercise habit but kept giving up halfway, repeatedly trapped in a cycle of starting over and then slacking off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One day, I was seized by a panic that my time was running out. This panic forced me to think: Am I going to live like this for the rest of my life? In this regard, it&amp;rsquo;s death that gives meaning to life.&lt;/strong&gt; Because if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the looming threat of death above my head, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have thought about this matter so earnestly. Consequently, I decided that I want to live to be 120 years old. In the past, when people asked me, I usually answered that around 80 years old would be fine. Not anymore. I plan to live as long as possible, preferably to 120 years old, and I want to have a vigorous body and a sharp mind to support me so that I can still travel, feel, and think critically in my old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t attach much importance to physical exercise before. My happiness often came from my brain rather than my limbs. The MBTI theory also gave me an explanation. Se (Extraverted Sensing) is my weak function, which means that I have a weak perception of objective reality, such as colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches, and I tend to overlook them. This also explains why I didn&amp;rsquo;t value physical exercise in my unconscious choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now I realize that I want to live as healthily as possible for a longer time. I realize that I want to go beyond those illusory thoughts and have some real contact with the world. I realize that perhaps my lack of energy and overly sentimental feelings in many cases may be due to the weakness of my physical qi and blood. I realize that I&amp;rsquo;m eager to have stronger control over my body so that it can support me to have better feelings and experiences&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;All these &amp;ldquo;realizations&amp;rdquo; have become a raging fire of motivation for me to keep exercising, so it has become a part of my life rather than a goal that needs to be achieved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the body, I also pay attention to my soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve realized again is that people don&amp;rsquo;t really care about their own souls. More people are concerned about how to be more successful, how to be more secure, how to be more superior, and they look for corresponding models, polish themselves, and fit themselves into those molds. Although they feel pain, society often says that they have &amp;ldquo;matured&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;grown up&amp;rdquo; at such times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is growth and maturity a kind of loss or a kind of gain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of last year, I was also extremely tormented by this question. The work environment and the relationships with colleagues were unpleasant. I was facing internal troubles as well as external threats. I spent a lot of energy condemning myself for being a deserter and not handling these messy things in a mature and appropriate way. What made it even more uncomfortable for me was that I knew that none of the individuals was a bad person, but in the whole system, it could naturally lead to a situation where everyone was competing and undercutting each other. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to undercut others. I slackened off in my behavior and felt double pain in my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, I already have a clear answer to the problem that once bothered me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No price of growth should be at the cost of losing oneself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of growth is to understand and satisfy oneself in a more comprehensive and delicate way. Use the highest level of imagination, aesthetic ability, and creativity to interpret oneself and create a fertile ground for oneself to survive and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the original problem from this perspective, whether the choice is to &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; or to &amp;ldquo;flee&amp;rdquo;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter anymore, because I no longer have any doubts about being myself and remaining true to myself. I will use social skills and strategies to smooth my real life, and when necessary, I will also move away for my own peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what is &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s another question. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss it today but will talk about it another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I always secretly complained that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t socialized enough. But now, I&amp;rsquo;ve completely given up forcing myself into those hateful values. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a false problem. I feel the desires of my soul and satisfy my soul. I try my best to keep it delicate, resilient, and tough. I hope it can feel and taste life delicately, capture some subtle yet crucial things, and I also hope that it won&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged and refuse to feel because of occasional disappointments and hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;02-a-career-that-inspires-passion-and-a-skill-for-making-money&#34;&gt;02 A Career that Inspires Passion and a Skill for Making Money
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to equate a career with starting a business, raising funds and the like, and thought that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for entrepreneurship. Although my parents started their business from scratch, my father had envisioned long ago that my younger brother and I could work together, with one taking charge of internal affairs and the other handling external affairs to build a successful business. But generally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my thoughts have changed dramatically. I must build my own career!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is something that can be done perfunctorily. Instead, we have an obligation to exert all our creativity and create favorable conditions for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, the goal of life is to build more robust relationships. We can build relationships with people, and we can also build relationships with things. However, building relationships with people is always more complex and dynamic, while building relationships with things can bring more stable and constant expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A career that can continuously inspire passion is like a magic bean in my opinion. It grows into a giant vine that reaches up to the sky, carrying us to a broader world and enabling us to meet like-minded people.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the backbone of our lives. People come and go, and flowers bloom and wither, but it always remains vibrant. It brings us financial rewards, freeing us from selling cheap fragments of our lives. It also brings us emotional rewards, leading us to establish win-win cooperative relationships and emotional connections with our peers. It&amp;rsquo;s the back-and-forth interaction between us and the world, correcting our misunderstandings and prejudices, and deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A career may sound like a big and intimidating thing that makes some people shrink back. But I think money is just one aspect of the measurement criteria. Some people set a higher standard for it, while others set a lower one. &lt;strong&gt;What I mean is that we are responsible for determining the field that we want to be involved in for the long term and designing its vitality mechanism so that it can bring positive feedback in aspects that we care about, such as money, reputation, emotions, etc., to support its continuous growth until one day you find that it has grown into a flourishing forest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;03-intimate-and-supportive-interpersonal-relationships&#34;&gt;03 Intimate and Supportive Interpersonal Relationships
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, I&amp;rsquo;m not specifically referring to the intimate relationship of a romantic partner, but rather interpersonal relationships that possess intimacy. We may build intimacy in different kinds of relationships, such as those with parents, children, siblings, teachers and students, friends, classmates, or even pen pals and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The existence of these identities doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean there is intimacy within them. We can explore opportunities to build intimacy in different relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people long for drama in interpersonal relationships, something intense, exciting, and full of drastic changes. It seems that in the expression of such intense drama, they can obtain a better gaming experience or a cosplay-like experience? They can feel the sense of being alive and the affirmation of their self-worth in the midst of such intense emotional ups and downs. But from my perspective, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I&amp;rsquo;m exploring the moments when I can feel intimacy, a sense of trust and closeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, I talked about some family topics with a friend. At that time, I mentioned that it seemed that I could only feel a pure and unadulterated emotion from my mother-in-law. And now, after all the ups and downs in the past half year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve built more trust with those important people during the changes. &lt;strong&gt;With such trust as the foundation, I can view those &amp;ldquo;impurities&amp;rdquo; more tolerantly, and I&amp;rsquo;m willing to invest a lot of energy in taking care of our relationships, making those &amp;ldquo;impurities&amp;rdquo; gradually seem insignificant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/chatting-about-this-mundane-yet-indispensable-topic-love-22.16.31/img.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Chatting about This Mundane yet Indispensable Topic Love" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should We Talk about Love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love? Does love still need to be talked about? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a cliché? From primary school textbooks to the process of growing up, the praises of love can be found everywhere. So what&amp;rsquo;s so special about love? Approaching my thirtieth year, during the dull days that seem like I&amp;rsquo;m constantly grinding in a mill, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering over the meaning and foundation of life. And it&amp;rsquo;s for the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve seriously taken out this topic: how to love and how to be loved. &lt;strong&gt;I think before the end of my life, I will complete some important answers, and &amp;ldquo;loving and being loved&amp;rdquo; will be one of the major questions. Later, with more persistent observation and thinking, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it&amp;rsquo;s actually a major question for everyone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering life as a one-way journey, what exactly are we doing all this for? Looking back from the end of life, what kind of state do we hope to achieve? — &lt;strong&gt;To obtain the unique wisdom of an individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we obtain wisdom? Wisdom requires experiences, immersion, feelings, thinking, and discrimination. And for the immersion and feelings among them, we need to embrace them with love. If we don&amp;rsquo;t live consciously with love, then we will be just a body enslaved by the subconscious, hidden rules, and emotions, skimming over the surface of life in a superficial way. And being superficial means that we will be repeatedly cooled and cooked in the boiling pot of love, hatred, and various emotions in the mortal world, unable to escape the cycle of reincarnation. However, living consciously can lead us to break through the cycle of reincarnation, just like reaching the other shore of wisdom through Prajna Paramita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is love so important? In &amp;ldquo;The Art of Loving&amp;rdquo;, Fromm said that since birth, people have to realize that they are lonely entities. This loneliness causes people&amp;rsquo;s anxiety. People&amp;rsquo;s addictions, indulgences, and sexual activities are all aimed at overcoming separation and the anxiety of loneliness. Therefore, from this perspective, &lt;strong&gt;love is the natural need of human beings as social animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just about love for people, but also love for things. Krishnamurti said in &amp;ldquo;The Significance of Life&amp;rdquo; that life is about relationships, and life means taking actions in relationships. The relationships here include those between us and ourselves, others, things, and dreams. &lt;strong&gt;The meaning of life lies in cultivating our relationships with the world, and love helps us cultivate more or deeper relationships. In the weaving of relationships, we will discover our close connection with the world and the value of our own existence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Understand &amp;ldquo;Love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Being Loved&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we talked about love in a rather cursory way. Later, I realized that love actually encompasses two separate aspects: &amp;ldquo;loving&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;being loved&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that different people actually have different lessons to learn. Some people know how to love but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be loved, while others know how to be loved but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to love. Of course, there are also those who are not good at either. In &amp;ldquo;The Art of Loving&amp;rdquo;, it is said that &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Most people would rather consider love as a problem of being loved than as a problem of loving, that is, as a problem of the ability to love. For them, love means how to be loved and how to make themselves lovable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Men pursue status and wealth, and women pursue beauty and charm, all in an attempt to have a seemingly higher exchange value in the market judged by public taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to understand &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo;? &lt;strong&gt;For me, love means attention, support, and responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt; I focus my scarce attention on you, observe you deeply, understand you, care about you, support you, and make commitments and take responsibilities. Taking responsibility means that at certain moments, for your sake or for the common good of both sides, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to sacrifice my personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;The Art of Loving&amp;rdquo;, Fromm discussed &amp;ldquo;symbiotic union&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mature love&amp;rdquo;. Symbiotic union is similar to the relationship between a mother and a fetus. In this kind of relationship, one side plays the role of a &amp;ldquo;sadist&amp;rdquo;, dominating the other side, and the other side plays the role of a &amp;ldquo;masochist&amp;rdquo;, submitting to the other side, with mutual psychological dependence. Observing real-life couples, it seems that most of them are like this. One side acts like a child, demanding companionship, attention, and money. The other side either demands the same things or complies with all the requests. I think this kind of heart-twisting sense of dependence can make people involved feel a strong sense of authority or being needed, thus making themselves feel less lonely. And &amp;ldquo;mature love&amp;rdquo; is a union under the condition of maintaining one&amp;rsquo;s own dignity and individuality. Mature love means care, responsibility, respect, and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;The Little Prince&amp;rdquo;, the little prince met a merchant who kept calculating the number of stars non-stop. In such calculations, the merchant regarded these stars as his own property. The little prince didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with him and said, &amp;ldquo;Let me tell you something else. I own a flower, and I water her every day. I own three volcanoes, and I clean them out every week. I even clean out the extinct volcanoes. Who knows when they might erupt! I&amp;rsquo;m useful to my volcanoes and my flower. But you&amp;rsquo;re of no use at all to the stars&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I own you because I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for you. &lt;strong&gt;Then I thought that actually we can&amp;rsquo;t own anything. What we own is just a period of time spent together, and we can decide what actions to take during that time and what will happen. Thus, the bond and relationship between you and me grow from this, and what I can truly own is this relationship and all the good and bad feelings it brings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the little prince also met a fox. The fox told him that &amp;ldquo;taming&amp;rdquo; is creating a relationship. If one side tames the other, it means that they need each other and are unique in each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes. How to understand &amp;ldquo;taming&amp;rdquo;? When watching &amp;ldquo;Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour Concert Film&amp;rdquo;, she showed a kind of vigorous and beautiful power on the stage. At that moment, I thought that she was like a wild horse, so powerful. She might stop voluntarily for a lush pasture, but no one could tame her. However, &amp;ldquo;The Little Prince&amp;rdquo; says that creating a relationship is &amp;ldquo;taming&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all forms of love, I think &amp;ldquo;romantic love&amp;rdquo; has its unique aspects. In family affection, we mostly feel safe. In friendship, we occupy each other&amp;rsquo;s attention to a limited extent. The relationship is sometimes closer and sometimes more distant, like the ebb and flow of the tide. We don&amp;rsquo;t feel uneasy within this rhythmic pattern. However, romantic love doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the kind of &amp;ldquo;guarantee&amp;rdquo; that family affection has, yet it demands a higher level of connection than family affection and friendship. We want the relationship to always be warm. If the temperature drops a little, we&amp;rsquo;ll feel cold and will be eager to solve the problem. People always seem to pursue certainty and a sense of security. Since people are very different from each other, it means that there are great differences in how individuals satisfy their sense of security and how they give it to others. In the process of such adaptation, the feelings of gain and loss in romantic love arise, or we can say the illusory gain and loss. Such illusory gain and loss control our ecstasy and our pain. But if we reexamine &amp;ldquo;possession&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sense of security&amp;rdquo;, can we filter out the uneasiness and suspicion in romantic love and leave only warmth behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does the sense of security in romantic love come from? The lack of security comes from the fear of losing and the fear that &amp;ldquo;he or she might not love me&amp;rdquo;. Such fear shows that once we enter into a romantic relationship, we subconsciously assume that we &amp;ldquo;possess&amp;rdquo; the other person. Otherwise, how can we talk about losing? This fear also reveals that for many people, the sweetness of romantic love comes from the belief that they are loved, thus getting recognition of their value. Once the other person shows some signs of not loving according to one&amp;rsquo;s own standards, one&amp;rsquo;s sense of self-worth will be challenged, and then one will feel a low sense of self-worth and feel pain. Especially, you can deceive yourself that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the evaluations of irrelevant people, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to deceive yourself that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the evaluations of the person you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of possessiveness, is possessiveness an impurity in romantic love or an inescapable dark side of it?&lt;/strong&gt; If it&amp;rsquo;s an impurity, then we can purify the feelings brought by romantic love by overcoming greed. If it&amp;rsquo;s a dark side, then it&amp;rsquo;s something necessary for a comprehensive understanding of romantic love. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for such a possessive desire, how could both sides invest enough attention in each other, thus leading and supporting each other to explore deeper and reach a realm that few have entered? I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite clear about this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of value recognition, being recognized is also a fundamental human need. If people haven&amp;rsquo;t established a solid system of value judgment for themselves and haven&amp;rsquo;t confirmed their own missions, then everything they do may be in pursuit of recognition, seeking recognition in mainstream society and social relationships. In such recognition, they feel &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;, a sense of completeness, and motivation. However, when one understands the achievements one wants to pursue, focuses on the achievements themselves rather than the halo of the achievements, and has an independent and solid system of value judgment, then one won&amp;rsquo;t be easily shaken in the recognition of one&amp;rsquo;s self-worth by rejections. In this process, you can relax more to enjoy the fact that &amp;ldquo;I love&amp;rdquo; and can also accept the fact that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not so loved&amp;rdquo; more calmly, and won&amp;rsquo;t feel too hurt because of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis for learning to be loved is self-love. Being loved is a kind of confidence in believing that one is worthy. In one episode of &amp;ldquo;Ugly Betty&amp;rdquo;, a debater discussed how much love a person who has suffered a lot of grievances needs to fill the void. At that time, Ma Dong said that a person who has suffered a lot of grievances only needs a little bit, just a tiny bit of love. This is to tell everyone that you should feel worthy of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-the-practice-of-love&#34;&gt;On the Practice of Love
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s era that emphasizes &amp;ldquo;independence&amp;rdquo;, there is a group of women who believe that I am a circle and you are also a circle, and our two circles move forward independently side by side. (Of course, there is also a group of women who claim to be disenchanted with love and men, thinking that love is not worth mentioning. What they mean by it not being worth mentioning is that love is not a necessity in life, and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to be involved in an unhappy or unsuitable relationship. After all, there are so many wonderful things in life. However, love is indeed an excellent environment for self-observation and the exploration of personal growth.) I wonder if one circle and another circle like this represent &amp;ldquo;mature love&amp;rdquo;? Is it the best practice of a relationship? It sounds good. I am a circle, and I walk through a certain scenery with you. Coincidentally, we have a pleasant time together. But when it&amp;rsquo;s time to take different paths, then we can just part ways. This kind of independence allows you to go anywhere. But then I think, for the other person, what&amp;rsquo;s so unique about us? Can we break up and say goodbye at any time? Is there a form where we are independent circles but can also have a tenon-and-mortise-like clasp to connect with each other? This clasp is probably the in-depth understanding of each other that we have gained over time and through shared experiences. In the journey of exploring ourselves and the world, you have already become my most important comrade and mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;The Little Prince&amp;rdquo;, it is said that it is the time you spent on your rose that makes this rose different from other roses. And this unique difference is precisely what we pursue. In the process of us becoming independent circles, we recognize our own uniqueness. And in this kind of intimate relationship, you are recognized for this uniqueness by another independent individual or, in a sense, by the world (excluding the kind of recognition by all of humanity at the top level). You are seen, recognized, and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of women&amp;rsquo;s independence nowadays, more highly educated people have become more &amp;ldquo;independent&amp;rdquo;. One result of this kind of independence is that &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t rely on you.&amp;rdquo; How to understand this &amp;ldquo;non-reliance&amp;rdquo;? Is it real independence? Or is it another form of the pursuit of certainty and a sense of security? She doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to control the other person but instead controls herself. By avoiding devoting herself wholeheartedly and relying on others, she tries to avoid possible hurt and pain in the future. This situation can be categorized as a lack of calmness and confidence in being loved. This kind of psychological self-protection leads to a lot of reserve, tentativeness, and avoidance. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve thought, why be afraid of falling? So what if you fall? Well, people are always afraid of getting hurt and are always trying to avoid harm. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave this question for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being calculating is also part of human nature. In all forms of love, we are happy to give. However, most of the time, these acts of giving are rather stingy as we expect the other person&amp;rsquo;s reciprocation in advance. And if the other person doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the expected feedback, it will trigger negative emotions. So we helplessly find that many conflicts in love stem from one person&amp;rsquo;s one-sided wish and the different feedback mechanisms of both sides. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to separate giving and receiving, regarding giving as an ordinary action rather than an investment. In such actions, you can obtain the happiness of emotional communication and flow. As for feedback? That&amp;rsquo;s something extra.&lt;/strong&gt; From this perspective, it seems that you can immerse yourself more calmly in the simple joy of loving and giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how to understand loving and being loved? &lt;strong&gt;Loving is a kind of courage that is not afraid of being let down, and being loved is a kind of confidence in believing that one is worthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the act of love, in the act of devoting myself, in the act of understanding another person, I found myself, I discovered myself, I discovered the two of us, and I discovered humanity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; In love, when we are obsessed with &amp;ldquo;loving or not loving&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;being together or not being together&amp;rdquo;, we are trapped in the anxiety of gain and loss, and we are calculating whether we have a little more or a little less. However, if we change our perspective, love is an excellent adventure for self-awareness and self-adjustment. Since it&amp;rsquo;s an adventure, there will be sunny days and rainy days. Let go of your obsession and enjoy your adventure. Get wet in the rain and then bask in the sun until you reach the boundary that you can&amp;rsquo;t cross anymore. Looking back at that time, perhaps you never knew that you could be so broad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Siddhartha realize on his path of seeking the Tao?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once human beings developed abstract thinking, there emerged a group of people in life who were always in pursuit of meaning and value, constantly asking questions like: As an individual &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;, how should I spend my life? In the end, what exactly are the questions that need to be answered in this lifetime? Thanks to some intermittent moments of enlightenment and confusion in my heart recently, I finally read this book that I had been longing to read for a long time. I hoped to consult and discuss with this poet from 60 years ago, and I found quite a lot of resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is rather thin and can be finished reading in just one morning, yet it is rich in meaning. Through the comparison of the identities and fates of different characters in the book, I gained a deeper understanding of the theme. The comparison between Siddhartha and Govinda shows two paths of seeking the Tao, one being worldly engagement and the other being withdrawal from the world. The comparison between Siddhartha and Kamala presents the paths of seeking the Tao for a saint who has fallen into the mortal world and a prostitute who yearns for answers. The comparison between Gautama and Vasudeva represents the paths of seeking the Tao through verbal instruction and thinking on the one hand and through personal example and experiencing on the other. The relationship between Siddhartha and his son reflects his transformation from a headstrong son who ran away from home to a pained father who had to accept his son&amp;rsquo;s departure. All these contrasts illustrate that wisdom cannot be taught, and worldly engagement is also of great importance. Everyone must experience their own lonely journey, think as well as experience, love and hate, hesitate, lose, and be tolerant, and then find their own unique wisdom. This is definitely not a Buddhist or Taoist book that advises people to let go; instead, it is precisely a book that gently encourages people to engage with the world and perceive wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siddhartha&amp;rsquo;s life can be divided into several stages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-setting-out-on-the-quest-from-selflessness-to-the-search-for-the-self&#34;&gt;I. Setting Out on the Quest: From Selflessness to the Search for the Self
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was originally the son of a Brahmin, wearing a halo of excellence and being a perfect student. Despite his outstanding achievements in spiritual practices, he felt an emptiness within his heart and doubted that the Atman was not to be found there. Thus, he resolutely bid farewell to his father and, together with his friend Govinda who followed him, became an ascetic monk. During his time as an ascetic monk, he practiced self-restraint and meditation, visualizing himself transforming into all things in the world to experience partings in life and death, as well as the processes of decay and disintegration. However, he discovered that although he had managed to break free from the sense of self thousands of times and even lingered in a state of selflessness for whole days, he always had to return to his own self in the end. The experiences as a samana failed to provide him with the answers he sought. So they went to pay their respects to Gautama, the World-Honored One. Gautama&amp;rsquo;s teachings were elaborate and attracted the disciples who came to him, including Govinda. But Siddhartha was an exception. He told the World-Honored One that Gautama&amp;rsquo;s wisdom did not lie in his teachings but in his own experiences, and that he himself needed to undergo those experiences personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Atman originated from ancient Indian philosophy. It pursues the truth of personal spirit and the universe, and holds that through spiritual practices, the two can be integrated harmoniously. Siddhartha failed to find his own Atman through debates, meditation, and contemplation. So he set out. At first, he practiced the method of selflessness but still found himself confused. When he reached middle age, he realized that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; was his own best teacher. He needed to understand himself, to get to know the mysterious Siddhartha. It was no longer about thinking but about experiencing through the &amp;ldquo;sensory perception&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person stifles the accidental self in the sense of the senses while nourishing the accidentally learned and capable self in the sense of the mind, he will not be able to find his true self. Both the mind and the senses are beautiful things. Ultimate meanings are hidden behind both of them. Both are worthy of being listened to and participated in. Neither should be despised, nor should they be overestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-experiences-in-the-mortal-world-detachment-and-sinking&#34;&gt;II. Experiences in the Mortal World: Detachment and Sinking
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha indulged his physical desires and plunged into the mortal world. He experienced the passion of love with the famous courtesan Kamala and also became a merchant to accumulate wealth. At first, although he was in the secular world, he still remained the Brahmin who was accustomed to spiritual practices and the son of a samana. He used &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;fasting, waiting, and thinking&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to understand the secular world. He played around in the mortal world, seeming detached from it all, made friends with many people and handled everything with ease. However, in his heart, he observed the people in the world as if they were children or animals, fluctuating among fame, wealth, desires, and emotions. He both envied and despised them. Eventually, he realized that he was living a ridiculous life. Although he was full of passion and completely absorbed in playing with others, and this game could occasionally bring him pleasure, the real life slipped away from him as his heart was not truly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, as he was immersed in the secular world, the samana within him died. He continued living and then found that he had become just like other ordinary people, being captured by love, hatred, desires, greed, and laziness. He felt empty and exhausted and left that place. He came to the riverside where the world and the spiritual realm intersected. At the moment when he was thinking of taking his own life, he reunited with his old friend Govinda. At this time, he was an ordinary and vulgar person in the world, while Govinda was a monk who firmly adhered to his spiritual path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortal world has its own wisdom, but it is also a vortex and a trap. Those who don&amp;rsquo;t think will sink into it, while those who think can break through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is not the key. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a quiet and sheltered corner in his heart. Although others might have it in their hearts, their intelligence was like that of children. Most people, like Kamala, were just like a fallen leaf, rolling and floating in the air, and finally staggering back to the dust. Only a very few people, like stars in the sky, moved along fixed orbits. No wind could shake them as they had their own laws and paths within their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-learning-from-the-river-endings-and-rebirths&#34;&gt;III. Learning from the River: Endings and Rebirths
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha felt somewhat absurd. In his pursuit of the true self, he took a &amp;ldquo;downward path&amp;rdquo;. He transformed from a thinker into an ordinary person in the world. He made himself act stupidly, learned about evil, made mistakes, and experienced disgust, disappointment, and pain. The Siddhartha who was once a samana died in the desires of the mortal world, and the Siddhartha who was immersed in the secular world also died in a state of desolation and exhaustion. Now, a newly reborn Siddhartha emerged! Siddhartha remembered that when he first entered the secular world, he had met a calm old ferryman by the river. He followed this old man and became a new ferryman himself, learning wisdom from the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the river that flowed ceaselessly day after day, he grasped the concepts of &amp;ldquo;listening without prejudice&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;time does not exist&amp;rdquo;. There was no past, no future; everything was just the essence and the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers are perhaps endowed with wisdom. Throughout history, both in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, so many people have attained philosophical insights by the riverside. There are lines like &amp;ldquo;A thousand sails pass by the wrecked ship&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Water benefits all things without contending&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The rolling waters of the Yangtze River flow eastward&amp;rdquo;, and also Lu Zhishen&amp;rsquo;s realization that &amp;ldquo;When the tide comes on the Qiantang River today, I finally know who I am&amp;rdquo;. What else did Siddhartha learn from the river? I think it was openness, tolerance, patience, and composure. To listen without preconceptions, to let go of the anxiety and fear about time, to break free from the shackles of yesterday and tomorrow, and to liberate the present self from being defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a sense of time pressure. Life is limited. There&amp;rsquo;s the saying &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s better to achieve fame as early as possible&amp;rdquo;, which implies that there are still opportunities for attempts and corrections. However, as people reach middle age or old age, the cost of giving up becomes higher, there is less energy for starting over, and the story of one&amp;rsquo;s life is almost set in stone. Therefore, perhaps the fear of loneliness and the fear of time can be regarded as the two fundamental fears in life. This also explains why people throughout the ages have always been devoted to seeking immortality and the Tao in an attempt to prolong life. Nevertheless, being born in this era, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that there are absolutely no opportunities at all. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to turbulences, changes, and waves, feeling both afraid and excited. I&amp;rsquo;m still unable to say calmly that &amp;ldquo;time does not exist&amp;rdquo;, which precisely proves that knowledge can be imparted, but wisdom cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iv-the-cycle-of-life-connection-and-enlightenment&#34;&gt;IV. The Cycle of Life, Connection, and Enlightenment
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha was engaged in meditation by the river, and it seemed as if he had returned to the calm Siddhartha of old. Until he reunited with Kamala and his son, whom he had never known about before. This reunion was both a separation and a new encounter. Siddhartha had a son and a new concern. He wanted to pass on what he had thought and learned to his son. However, his son did not appreciate it, and time did not soften his son&amp;rsquo;s attitude. Siddhartha persisted in his pain until his son ran away from home. His son&amp;rsquo;s reluctance to yield was just like how he, in his youth, had stubbornly stood by his father&amp;rsquo;s bedside. Everyone has their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha embarked on the journey of searching for his son. When he was an ordinary person in the world, he both envied and despised the people. He understood and sympathized with the fact that people&amp;rsquo;s lives were governed not by thoughts and reason but by impulses and desires. Now, he envied the intense love between parents and children among the people, feeling sad and yearning. Those desires that he once thought were simple, stupid, and intense were no longer naive, vain, or absurd. He saw life and vitality in them, as well as things that were lovely and worthy of respect. &lt;strong&gt;He realized that the only difference between ordinary people and thinkers was self - awareness, the conscious thinking about life as a whole. And perhaps the value of this self - awareness had been overestimated. Ordinary people were not as shallow as he had thought, and he was not as profound as he had imagined.&lt;/strong&gt; He had an epiphany: What exactly is wisdom? It is nothing but the ability to think in a harmonious and unified way at every moment of life, to feel and integrate into this unified soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain of missing his son and not being able to have his love reciprocated still tormented Siddhartha. However, when Siddhartha stood by the river and looked back on the story of his life, his passion, love, hatred, desires, and martial skills were no longer isolated and specific in the sound of the surging river. Instead, they converged into a unified joy of life. This made Siddhartha&amp;rsquo;s wounds bloom and achieve completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indulging in knowledge is like any other kind of hysteria. It provides a way of escape, allowing one to avoid the fear of emptiness, loneliness, frustration, and worthlessness. The radiance of knowledge is a subtle disguise, beneath which lies the darkness that the heart cannot penetrate. The heart fears this unknown, so it escapes into knowledge, theories, hopes, and imagination. And this kind of knowledge is precisely an obstacle to understanding the unknown. - Krishnamurti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;v-perfect-wisdom-reunion-and-conclusion&#34;&gt;V. Perfect Wisdom, Reunion, and Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha returned to the riverside and continued to be the ferryman. One day, he met his friend Govinda again, with whom he had parted ways in their youth. Govinda had been firm in his religious belief throughout his life, following the monastic rules and constantly seeking answers. He had followed Siddhartha to leave the land of the Brahmins and became an ascetic monk. Eventually, influenced by Gautama, the World - Honored One, he converted to Gautama&amp;rsquo;s teachings and left Siddhartha, whom he had originally intended to follow for a lifetime. Now, due to his advanced age, Govinda was respected by the young monks, but his restlessness and pursuit had not ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha said to him, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;A seeker often only focuses on the object of his search. He gains nothing and absorbs nothing because he is solely preoccupied with seeking and is dominated by his goal. Seeking means having a target, while discovery means freedom, openness, and being completely without purpose. You may indeed be a seeker, but because you are striving hard to pursue your goal, you miss some things right in front of you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Govinda asked Siddhartha for teachings. Siddhartha said, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Knowledge can be shared, but wisdom cannot. It can only be discovered and experienced.&amp;rdquo; He told Govinda that the opposite of truth may also be true. Everything that can be thought and spoken of is one - sided, partial, lacking in wholeness, perfection, and unity. The contradictions of things coexist in one place. All sins carry forgiveness. The old dwell within all children. The paths of robbers and gamblers may lead to the Buddha, and the path of a Brahmin may lead to a robber. Siddhartha talked about his enlightenment: &amp;ldquo;I follow the arrangements of my soul and body, experience sins, pursue carnal desires and wealth, be vain, and fall into the most shameful despair, so as to learn to give up struggling and learn to love the world. I no longer compare this world with the perfect world I expected and created, but accept this world, love it, and belong to it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Perhaps it is precisely words that prevent you from attaining peace. For me, love is the top priority. Examining the world, explaining the world, or despising the world may be the business of thinkers. My only business is to love the world. Do not despise the world, do not hate the world or myself. Look at all things that exist and myself with love, amazement, and awe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the process of imparting the teachings, Siddhartha achieved perfection, wearing a calm, gentle, compassionate, and slightly mocking smile, just like the smile of the Buddha. And Govinda, the monk who had been searching for a lifetime and still had doubts in his heart, recalled all the things he had loved in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-enlightenment-from-siddhartha&#34;&gt;The Enlightenment from Siddhartha
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s pursuit often begins when they are troubled by worldly desires in the real world and want to seek how to maintain a pure and natural state of mind. The path they choose is to let go and abandon. However, abandoning loss, pain, and anger also means giving up expectations, desires, and happiness. Only in this way can true peace be achieved. Siddhartha&amp;rsquo;s path of seeking the Tao was not like this. He was born seemingly at the destination, yet he found that truth could not be obtained through verbal instruction. So he chose to experience and even &amp;ldquo;descend&amp;rdquo; in the opposite way. This journey was all about harvest and experience. Regarding the secular world, he changed from indifference to disgust and finally to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own journey has some similarities with Siddhartha&amp;rsquo;s. Although I&amp;rsquo;m not at the so-called destination, I started to engage in self-reflection at an early stage. I spent a lot of time focusing on myself and amusing myself, leaving little time for the real world and others. There was a period when I was chatting with my depressed relatives and friends, and I felt complacent about my own self-reflection and self-regulation. However, one day, I suddenly became confused. I stuffed all those unhappy moments into a mental &amp;ldquo;cabinet&amp;rdquo; and shut them away in a disorderly manner, just like out of sight, out of mind. I gave up sadness, but also gave up joy. I once pitied them, but now I envy them. Then I realized that what I once thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t need might be a cowardly escape. I began to rethink what I desired, what I needed, and what the questions were that life needed to answer. The first answer I wrote down was &amp;ldquo;love and being loved&amp;rdquo;. Both love and being loved need to be learned, yet most people act on instinct, unable to build relationships or even hurt each other in intimate relationships. The similarity between me and Siddhartha lies in that this journey forward is not a journey of letting go but a journey of opening up. Opening oneself up, experiencing the world, and taking care of one&amp;rsquo;s own heart can lead to a deeper understanding rather than superficial thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, self-reflection and understanding are never-ending processes, especially for me at present. Sometimes I gain strength from new understandings, while at other times I encounter setbacks in the real world and then start to question, think, and adjust again. Occasionally, I explore the wisdom of others from highly praised films, TV shows, and books, and I can always find resonance and recognition. I believe that I&amp;rsquo;m on the right path of thinking. In the past, for a while, I felt pessimistic because I felt that I was drifting away from my &amp;ldquo;true self&amp;rdquo;. Now, although there are still sad moments, I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I haven&amp;rsquo;t learned &amp;ldquo;fasting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;waiting&amp;rdquo; and haven&amp;rsquo;t dealt well with people&amp;rsquo;s anxiety and lack of confidence in the face of uncertainty. Generally speaking, I&amp;rsquo;m still happy because I&amp;rsquo;m getting closer to my &amp;ldquo;true self&amp;rdquo;. After reading this book, I found many ideas that coincided with my own thoughts, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to record a few of them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This journey is a lonely one, and we should accept this loneliness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After establishing the theme of &amp;ldquo;love and being loved&amp;rdquo;, my attitude towards a life partner has also changed slightly, from being pessimistic to being embracing. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to having a spiritual companion who can accompany me to read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles. I&amp;rsquo;m longing for a lasting and profound relationship. However, I think I might be wrong again. Although my expectation is not completely unrealistic, isn&amp;rsquo;t it too luxurious in the real world? Is the pursuit of &amp;ldquo;longevity&amp;rdquo; in a relationship correct? In &amp;ldquo;The Art of Loving&amp;rdquo;, Fromm said that people&amp;rsquo;s fundamental anxiety comes from a sense of loneliness and the fear of coming and going alone in life. So people are always seeking things to resist this loneliness, such as alcohol, drugs, and love. I then began to wonder: Spiritual resonance is one of the things that can help us resist loneliness, but does it have to come from a life partner? Or can it come from friends? Or is writing even more reliable? Longevity in a relationship is so hard to achieve. Compared with the length of time, is the sense of deep participation when we are together the most important? If &amp;ldquo;love and being loved&amp;rdquo; is a proposition that I hope to answer, then should I study and accept a broader form of love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha and Kamala had a long-term relationship of love and passion. However, one day, Siddhartha got tired of his vulgar self in the secular world and left without saying goodbye. Kamala didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. She understood him. Siddhartha once said that it was precisely because Kamala didn&amp;rsquo;t love anyone that she could understand the art of love. Does this mean that when a person attaches too much importance to love, elevates it too highly, and places too many expectations on it, he or she will actually fail to truly understand it? Instead, with a normal and playful heart, one can get a chance to glimpse the mystery. This is the next topic for me to explore. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been too serious and haven&amp;rsquo;t mastered the balance between playfulness and sincerity yet. Kamala loved Siddhartha, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly infatuated or dependent. She also had her own pursuits. In the later stage of her life, she donated all her wealth to Gautama and took her child to pay respects to the deceased Gautama. By the river, she was bitten by a poisonous snake. When she met Siddhartha, who was working as a ferryman by the river, in a moment of clarity, she just looked at Siddhartha and said, &amp;ldquo;Dear, you&amp;rsquo;re old.&amp;rdquo; She calmly let him go without any resentment. When they met again, she said the warm words, &amp;ldquo;Dear, you&amp;rsquo;re old.&amp;rdquo; I think that&amp;rsquo;s really nice. Marina Abramović has a moving work called &amp;ldquo;The Artist Is Present&amp;rdquo;. She sat there and had a one-minute eye contact with strangers. It&amp;rsquo;s a very inspiring work. What&amp;rsquo;s more dramatic is the arrival of an unexpected person, who was her former creative partner and lover. They had created many thought-provoking works together and their souls were highly compatible. However, they eventually broke up. Years later, when they reunited, they sat there, looked into each other&amp;rsquo;s eyes, burst into tears, and then held each other&amp;rsquo;s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of life is a lonely one. Siddhartha separated from his father, from Govinda, from Kamala, and from his son, chasing after his own answers. And everyone has to live a lonely life because of the answers they seek. The hope for a lifetime together is too luxurious and is almost doomed to disappointment. Perhaps starting with a playful attitude and participating sincerely can make this lonely journey also a brilliant and lively one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly are we looking for in our lifetime? Truth, creation, and love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I lived in my own mind, in an illusory self in my mind. I talked to my friends about my sense of detachment. And on many nights, I imagined that the bed beneath me would crack open and I would fall into a void, an alien world where no one could find me. But I selfishly hoped that the time flow would be different, that my friends in this world wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too sad, that they would be a little sad but not too much. Such a state is probably the absurd state of playing in the world that Gautama experienced. He lived a normal life, but he knew that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t truly here. He yearned to participate in and feel the present moment as deeply as other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the path of seeking Atman, Gautama first eliminated the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; and then sought the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;. He first learned from doctrines and practices, and then from worldly experiences. Finally, he no longer compared this world with the perfect world he expected and created but accepted this world, loved it, and belonged to it. The advantage of our personality is its purity, while the pain mostly comes from thinking too much, doing too little, and being mostly closed in our hearts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeking how I can become a more complete and whole &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo;. The final answer is that only by putting myself into a broader range of experiences and emotions can I meet a fuller and more real self, which coincides with the teachings of the book to some extent. However, such thinking sometimes leads me into another kind of irrationality. I regard all these as life experiences, taste my own feelings and changes in this process, think about why I have such feelings, and finally reconcile with these feelings. But this seems to occasionally become a kind of 偏执 and recklessness, falling into another form of being blinded by a single leaf and causing trouble for others. Fortunately, I also have gains. Through daily conversations with myself, I feel that two vivid personalities have formed in my body. One is like a child&amp;rsquo;s personality, responsible for feeling delicately, still with a child&amp;rsquo;s timidity. The other is like an adult&amp;rsquo;s personality, responsible for rationally collecting data about myself. So even when I&amp;rsquo;m extremely sad, there&amp;rsquo;s still a voice in my mind analyzing why I have such feelings at this moment, what the essence of these feelings is, and whether these feelings are reasonable. Sometimes I even become poetic and can come up with a metaphor for my sad mood at that moment. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m sick, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve got a panacea that can cure everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the theme, what exactly are we looking for in our lifetime? At this moment, my answer is &amp;ldquo;truth, creation, and love&amp;rdquo;. On the path of pursuit, I hope to be brave, sincere, and passionate. Truth refers to the understanding of the world and oneself, which is also the unique, profound, and harmonious understanding that people obtain after their own journeys, as Siddhartha said. Creation emphasizes action, emphasizes traveling thousands of miles, emphasizes the unity of knowledge and action, emphasizes creating value, and emphasizes bringing benefits and meaning to others. Without creation, there is no truth. Love refers to opening up, accepting, experiencing, and perceiving, not being a thinking ascetic monk but being a lively person full of emotions. Feelings, thinking, and actions prompt us to get closer to the truth. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m also clear about my own shortcomings and the qualities I cherish. I hope that on this journey of exploration, I can always be brave, never forget to be sincere, and arouse passion. Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s also anger, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether it should be included for now. I keep thinking about these qualities while experiencing and feeling, and gradually I no longer cling to the results because I hope to be brave and live in the real world. And what is meant by being brave and real will have different answers for different people in their own explorations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how to answer Siddhartha&amp;rsquo;s question? The more you are obsessed with the result of pursuing something and become narrow-minded and focused, the more you will find that the answer is not on this path at the end. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s about not being obsessed with definite answers and life itself. You just set up a &amp;ldquo;bright moon&amp;rdquo; to pursue and several guiding principles in the lonely wilderness, and the &amp;ldquo;bright moon&amp;rdquo; will naturally guide you to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
