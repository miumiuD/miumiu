    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Previously, we talked about how the meaning of life lies in building some strong relationships. Such relationships can make us truly feel happy and help us overcome challenges when faced with trials.</p>
<p>So, what kinds of relationships do we need to build?</p>
<p>In October 2023, I was traveling in Paris with Ko. One night, we were sitting outside a bistro in Paris, and she asked me what the three most important things in my life would be.</p>
<p>Do you have a clear and definite answer for yourself?</p>
<p>Up to now, maybe there has been a slight change, and here are my current choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>A strong and agile body and mind.</li>
<li>A career that inspires passion and a skill for making money.</li>
<li>Intimate and supportive interpersonal relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is actually quite similar to Naval&rsquo;s formula for happiness. Naval once gave a life formula: Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Interpersonal Relationships.</p>
<p>In the book &ldquo;Principles&rdquo;, Ray Dalio also put forward that for him, a successful life means having meaningful work and meaningful interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>I believe that for most people, if they want a balanced and sustainable sense of happiness, their final answers will probably be more or less the same, regarding health, love, and work. However, the important thing is not that we know a &ldquo;standard answer&rdquo;. The crucial point is that we need to rule out options one by one, carefully analyze and distinguish, and then derive our own clear and definite answers. It&rsquo;s like drawing up a personal charter. This process implies genuine recognition and commitment. <strong>It means that we will do our best to build relationships with them in a creative and responsible way. We won&rsquo;t always be led by the nose by urgent tasks, nor will we damage these relationships because of trifles in life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="01-a-strong-body-and-a-sensitive-mind">01 A Strong Body and a Sensitive Mind
</h3><p>Everyone knows that health is important and exercise is important. However, the reality is that people often say one thing and do another. <strong>The reason, I think, is that people just repeat some ideas that have been instilled into them without truly identifying with those values at a fundamental level, so naturally those ideas can&rsquo;t guide their behaviors.</strong></p>
<p>Just as the widely circulated saying on the Internet goes, human beings are like parrots.</p>
<p>This also explains why I always wanted to develop an exercise habit but kept giving up halfway, repeatedly trapped in a cycle of starting over and then slacking off again.</p>
<p><strong>One day, I was seized by a panic that my time was running out. This panic forced me to think: Am I going to live like this for the rest of my life? In this regard, it&rsquo;s death that gives meaning to life.</strong> Because if it weren&rsquo;t for the looming threat of death above my head, I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about this matter so earnestly. Consequently, I decided that I want to live to be 120 years old. In the past, when people asked me, I usually answered that around 80 years old would be fine. Not anymore. I plan to live as long as possible, preferably to 120 years old, and I want to have a vigorous body and a sharp mind to support me so that I can still travel, feel, and think critically in my old age.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t attach much importance to physical exercise before. My happiness often came from my brain rather than my limbs. The MBTI theory also gave me an explanation. Se (Extraverted Sensing) is my weak function, which means that I have a weak perception of objective reality, such as colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches, and I tend to overlook them. This also explains why I didn&rsquo;t value physical exercise in my unconscious choices.</p>
<p>However, now I realize that I want to live as healthily as possible for a longer time. I realize that I want to go beyond those illusory thoughts and have some real contact with the world. I realize that perhaps my lack of energy and overly sentimental feelings in many cases may be due to the weakness of my physical qi and blood. I realize that I&rsquo;m eager to have stronger control over my body so that it can support me to have better feelings and experiences&hellip; <strong>All these &ldquo;realizations&rdquo; have become a raging fire of motivation for me to keep exercising, so it has become a part of my life rather than a goal that needs to be achieved.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the body, I also pay attention to my soul.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve realized again is that people don&rsquo;t really care about their own souls. More people are concerned about how to be more successful, how to be more secure, how to be more superior, and they look for corresponding models, polish themselves, and fit themselves into those molds. Although they feel pain, society often says that they have &ldquo;matured&rdquo; and &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; at such times.</p>
<p>So is growth and maturity a kind of loss or a kind of gain?</p>
<p>For most of last year, I was also extremely tormented by this question. The work environment and the relationships with colleagues were unpleasant. I was facing internal troubles as well as external threats. I spent a lot of energy condemning myself for being a deserter and not handling these messy things in a mature and appropriate way. What made it even more uncomfortable for me was that I knew that none of the individuals was a bad person, but in the whole system, it could naturally lead to a situation where everyone was competing and undercutting each other. I didn&rsquo;t want to undercut others. I slackened off in my behavior and felt double pain in my spirit.</p>
<p>Up to now, I already have a clear answer to the problem that once bothered me.</p>
<p><strong>No price of growth should be at the cost of losing oneself.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of growth is to understand and satisfy oneself in a more comprehensive and delicate way. Use the highest level of imagination, aesthetic ability, and creativity to interpret oneself and create a fertile ground for oneself to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>When looking at the original problem from this perspective, whether the choice is to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; or to &ldquo;flee&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, because I no longer have any doubts about being myself and remaining true to myself. I will use social skills and strategies to smooth my real life, and when necessary, I will also move away for my own peace.</p>
<p>However, what is &ldquo;self&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s another question. I won&rsquo;t discuss it today but will talk about it another day.</p>
<p>In the past, I always secretly complained that I wasn&rsquo;t socialized enough. But now, I&rsquo;ve completely given up forcing myself into those hateful values. I think it&rsquo;s a false problem. I feel the desires of my soul and satisfy my soul. I try my best to keep it delicate, resilient, and tough. I hope it can feel and taste life delicately, capture some subtle yet crucial things, and I also hope that it won&rsquo;t be discouraged and refuse to feel because of occasional disappointments and hurts.</p>

<h3 id="02-a-career-that-inspires-passion-and-a-skill-for-making-money">02 A Career that Inspires Passion and a Skill for Making Money
</h3><p>I used to equate a career with starting a business, raising funds and the like, and thought that I wasn&rsquo;t suitable for entrepreneurship. Although my parents started their business from scratch, my father had envisioned long ago that my younger brother and I could work together, with one taking charge of internal affairs and the other handling external affairs to build a successful business. But generally, I didn&rsquo;t listen to him.</p>
<p>Now, my thoughts have changed dramatically. I must build my own career!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is something that can be done perfunctorily. Instead, we have an obligation to exert all our creativity and create favorable conditions for ourselves.</p>
<p>Why is this so necessary?</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the goal of life is to build more robust relationships. We can build relationships with people, and we can also build relationships with things. However, building relationships with people is always more complex and dynamic, while building relationships with things can bring more stable and constant expectations.</p>
<p><strong>A career that can continuously inspire passion is like a magic bean in my opinion. It grows into a giant vine that reaches up to the sky, carrying us to a broader world and enabling us to meet like-minded people.</strong> It is the backbone of our lives. People come and go, and flowers bloom and wither, but it always remains vibrant. It brings us financial rewards, freeing us from selling cheap fragments of our lives. It also brings us emotional rewards, leading us to establish win-win cooperative relationships and emotional connections with our peers. It&rsquo;s the back-and-forth interaction between us and the world, correcting our misunderstandings and prejudices, and deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world.</p>
<p>A career may sound like a big and intimidating thing that makes some people shrink back. But I think money is just one aspect of the measurement criteria. Some people set a higher standard for it, while others set a lower one. <strong>What I mean is that we are responsible for determining the field that we want to be involved in for the long term and designing its vitality mechanism so that it can bring positive feedback in aspects that we care about, such as money, reputation, emotions, etc., to support its continuous growth until one day you find that it has grown into a flourishing forest.</strong></p>

</h3><p>Here, I&rsquo;m not specifically referring to the intimate relationship of a romantic partner, but rather interpersonal relationships that possess intimacy. We may build intimacy in different kinds of relationships, such as those with parents, children, siblings, teachers and students, friends, classmates, or even pen pals and so on.</p>
<p><strong>The existence of these identities doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean there is intimacy within them. We can explore opportunities to build intimacy in different relationships.</strong></p>
<p>Some people long for drama in interpersonal relationships, something intense, exciting, and full of drastic changes. It seems that in the expression of such intense drama, they can obtain a better gaming experience or a cosplay-like experience? They can feel the sense of being alive and the affirmation of their self-worth in the midst of such intense emotional ups and downs. But from my perspective, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m exploring the moments when I can feel intimacy, a sense of trust and closeness.</p>
<p>In January, I talked about some family topics with a friend. At that time, I mentioned that it seemed that I could only feel a pure and unadulterated emotion from my mother-in-law. And now, after all the ups and downs in the past half year or so, I&rsquo;ve built more trust with those important people during the changes. <strong>With such trust as the foundation, I can view those &ldquo;impurities&rdquo; more tolerantly, and I&rsquo;m willing to invest a lot of energy in taking care of our relationships, making those &ldquo;impurities&rdquo; gradually seem insignificant.</strong></p>
