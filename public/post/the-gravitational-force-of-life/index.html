    <p>Over the past two years, I&rsquo;ve been pondering what kind of person I hope to become and what kind of life I expect to have. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve also been observing and taking stock of what things will promote my growth and what will hold me back.
I&rsquo;ve gradually summed up some key points. Some of them are my habitual reactions, which, like gravity, make me sink in life and require me to consciously recognize and overcome them. While others are aspects that I remind myself to cultivate and strengthen, so as to put myself in a better state and attract dreams and good fortune.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="01-the-gravity-of-life">01. The Gravity of Life
</h3><p>For me, the two most crucial aspects are greed and laziness.
For others, the answers might be different. For example, for some people, it might be arrogance; for others, it could be a sense of superiority; some might struggle with inferiority, and still others might have a problem with not being able to tell what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s not&hellip;
All in all, the first step is to identify these issues, and the second step is to make adjustments.</p>
<h4 id="greed">Greed
</h4><p>The first drawback of greed is shallowness.
To put it simply, greed means wanting everything. However, people&rsquo;s time and attention are limited. The consequence of wanting everything is that it&rsquo;s difficult for us to allocate sufficient resources to certain things and build strong relationships with them. We always just touch the surface, linger everywhere, and build a very broad network, yet it&rsquo;s rather weak and can be easily broken. Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve also been reorganizing my desires, choosing those that I&rsquo;m willing to invest in for the long term and suppressing those that are just on a whim. I think there are some higher-level and more delightful joys that come from persistent efforts in one thing. Then, at a certain moment, it can bring about the understanding of related things and epiphanies. It&rsquo;s like getting along with some things as if they were old friends, and then discovering something new in these old friends, savoring new flavors from the familiar.
The second drawback of greed is getting sidetracked.
For instance, when I&rsquo;m confused and get a flash of inspiration from a certain type of book, I&rsquo;m almost tempted to shut myself up and read all the related books until I can build a framework and no longer be troubled by such problems. Then I start collecting reading lists. My focus shifts from this specific small problem at hand to a larger problem that&rsquo;s not so urgent in the short term. My energy is diverted from solving this small problem to collecting reading lists, which is an indirect and problem-solving-ineffective thing. My attention shifts from focusing on this small problem to the anxiety that there&rsquo;s never enough time.</p>
<h4 id="laziness">Laziness
</h4><p>I&rsquo;m an extremely lazy person. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s because I have very low energy levels. I can&rsquo;t stay up late at all. My mind doesn&rsquo;t work very fast either. Group activities are like recharging for others, but for me, they&rsquo;re draining my energy. I have little energy to start with, my mind operates slowly, and I consume energy quickly in daily life, so I&rsquo;m often in a low-energy-consuming mode, daydreaming. However, I don&rsquo;t plan to change this now. It&rsquo;s really hard to boost my mental speed. Instead of forcing myself to work harder, I can only figure out a battlefield that suits me better. For example, studying some classics is more suitable for me than researching hot topics.
On the other hand, I have very low initiative. I think a lot but do little. This is probably a common problem and doesn&rsquo;t need much explanation. Not only is my initiative low, but I also have high aspirations but low abilities. I don&rsquo;t want to do this or that. This is really not good, and I need to find some strategies to deal with it.</p>
<h3 id="02-the-gravitational-pull-of-life">02. The Gravitational Pull of Life
</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve selected these aspects one by one as the gravitational pull for myself: curiosity, courage, honesty, and happiness.</p>
<h4 id="curiosity">Curiosity
</h4><p>I think the essential quality for a good life needs to include curiosity.
We need to have curiosity when we look forward to a better self and a better life. We need curiosity when we design a better life. When building a career, we also need very high-quality and focused curiosity.
Without curiosity, everything is just: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;
With curiosity, everything can be: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than that.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="courage">Courage
</h4><p>As the saying on the Internet goes: &ldquo;The brave ones get to enjoy the world first.&rdquo;
Regardless of whether this slogan-like declaration is correct or not, on the path of satisfying curiosity and moving forward on our own, courage is essential. People without courage can&rsquo;t move forward independently and gain freedom. At some necessary moments, after assessing our own strength, we need to have the courage to take a leap.
Moreover, it takes enough courage to stay honest. We need to face difficulties, face reality squarely, and make detours when necessary.</p>
<h4 id="honesty">Honesty
</h4><p>Honesty is also something that I&rsquo;ve come to value more and more. Be honest with myself and be honest with the world.
When I realize my desires, my sadness, my anxiety, my weakness&hellip; I admit them for what they are, analyze them, and soothe them instead of disguising them.
Another thing that struck me this year is that recognition is a kind of power.
During my conversations with my mother, I&rsquo;ve been more open and unrestrained in chatting with her about many things, like her new relationship, her sexual experiences, and so on.
When we try to hide certain things, this attitude of hiding and not recognizing them brings a psychological burden. But when we communicate normally, the sense of uneasiness and insecurity in the other person&rsquo;s heart disappears. She gains a more aboveboard confidence, and I can also feel her relaxation and trust in me.
I&rsquo;m trying to be more honest in facing myself and communicating with others. Actually, I think different groups of people have different local rules. I choose the rules that make me feel more relaxed and empowered, as well as the people and situations where these rules can bring me positive feedback.
Be honest with the world, be honest with reality, and be honest with the rules.
When we encounter setbacks, we often spend a lot of time taking care of our self-esteem. But what hurts us is our own inferiority and self-pity.
I&rsquo;m trying to accept reality and the rules of reality more. Reality is indifferent, treating all things as straw dogs. People only care about those things and people that are related to them and helpful to them. So you don&rsquo;t have to feel sad just because you seem insignificant and unnoticed. Rules are those that govern interpersonal interactions. They are a reality and an objective existence that apply to everyone. Instead of always being accidentally hurt by them, feeling sad and discouraged, and then making wrong attributions to comfort our self-esteem, it&rsquo;s better to face them honestly in a neutral way, recognize them, adapt to them, and practice using them.</p>
<h4 id="happiness">Happiness
</h4><p>I met a girl in Chiang Mai. She said that when you don&rsquo;t know how to choose, just choose happiness. At that time, I refuted her, thinking that happiness was a short-sighted choice and that it might not necessarily bring us what we really want. Now, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.
I dislike being overly serious and pretentious. Although what I&rsquo;m writing here might seem rather serious and pretentious too. We naturally love stories, games, and happiness. I can&rsquo;t help but always look for meaning and value in everything. However, being too serious and solemn leaves no room for discovering fun and absurdity. What I want to remind myself is that I don&rsquo;t have to be so solemn. We can be more relaxed and cheerful&hellip; In a world that&rsquo;s only about meaning, we can&rsquo;t recognize meaning. We recognize meaning because we first recognize meaninglessness.
After Fu Hang became famous overnight, he said in an interview: &ldquo;In this world, both you and I are too involved in our roles, and that will bring pain. People are inexplicably pushed forward by fate. Suddenly, you become a mother, a child, or an employee, but we all take these roles too seriously.&rdquo;
Yes, I also think that sometimes we take our roles too seriously.
I also saw an interesting post. An overseas student put a sofa in different street scenes and took many photos with it. I thought he was doing some artistic creation. In fact, he was just a German student studying abroad. He bought a second-hand sofa and wanted to move it home with his friends. The sofa was so heavy that they had to take a break after moving it a short distance. So he simply turned it into a fun thing and took many &ldquo;blockbuster&rdquo; photos. Turning a tiring task into an interesting memory is the magic of finding happiness.
Having a cheerful mood is very important, so don&rsquo;t be so serious and gloomy.
